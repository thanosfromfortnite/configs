# How to use

On a newly imaged machine after getting through the setup prompts:
- Sign out of test (Do not switch accounts, you must fully sign out)
- Sign into Tech Squad

## In Tech Squad:
- Run the "RUN ALL.ps1" file depending on which machine you're configuring
- "Others" has the option to leave name unchanged so you can sign into a domain on your own.
- Do all of the other necessary configurations if needed (Run Deepfreeze installer)
- Optional: Run the chrome update installer script.

## In Student/Teacher:
- Make sure you're unfrozen
- Run "set default apps.bat"
- Do all the other necessary configurations
